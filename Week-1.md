**Week 1** 
==============

## **Notation and background** 


* We write $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ to describe $n$ data points.
* As an example, consider the data set $\{1, 2, 5\}$ then 
  * $X_1 = 1$, $X_2 = 2$, $X_3 = 5$ and $n = 3$.
* We often use a different letter than $X$, such as $Y_1, \ldots , Y_n$.
* We will typically use Greek letters for things we don't know. 
  Such as, $\mu$ is a mean that we'd like to estimate
